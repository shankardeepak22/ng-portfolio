        <h3>What I Do</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a Senior Software Engineer at MathWorks, where I work on web applications,
          distributed systems, and microservices architecture. I spend most of my time writing
          Java and JavaScript, designing APIs, and solving problems across the full stack.
